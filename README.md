# hello, rustaceans!

I'm finally picking up a new language to learn and decided to go with the rust lang. 


in this repository are projects to track my learning journey. hope it helps you.


## rusty?

why rust, since i'm very new to the space, most of the things i know about the language is from what i have read on the internet and from books. howbeit, i hope i can also convince you by regurgitating what i have learned in my own words.


## rust is a language for systems programming

briefly a systems programming language helps the programmer make full use of a systems resources to build applications that rely solely on these resources to function efficiently.


what i mean by this is, in systems programming every resource piece[eg: memory, I/O, CPU usage] used by the programmer should be accounted for. not wasted or used in such a way that's not meaningful. systems programming is resource-constrained programming.


these languages with rust specifically provide features such access to hardware and memory, concurrency, memory safety, etc. Features that are going to push machines to the limit but also providing reliable piece of software.

### examples

systems programmers code almost all of our most used and reliable systems where reliability and efficiently is needed such as:

#### operating systems

#### databases

#### media codecs

#### media processing

#### memory management

#### text rendering

#### scientific simulations

#### games

#### virtualization and software containers

#### embedded applications


_your feedback is greatly appreciated._
